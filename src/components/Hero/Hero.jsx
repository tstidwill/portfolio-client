            Hi there 👋🏼 <br />
            I’m a Canadian Software Engineer with a passion for sustainability
            and a talent for problem-solving. I earned my B.Sc. in Mathematics
            from McGill University and recently graduated from BrainStation's
            Software Engineering Bootcamp. <br />
            <br />
            I’m committed to applying my skills to develop innovative,
            sustainable solutions that make a positive impact on the world. When
            I’m not coding, you can find me practicing yoga, dabbling in
            pottery, or connecting with nature. I look forward to connecting!
